        <p>Modern rally cars have become somewhat safer and more limited, but it is not worth comparing them with the wild style and raw power of the 80s. Unfortunately, this is also emphasized in the news, for example in the case of the Monte Carlo Rally, when a spectator died - which could have been completely avoided, according to the report - attention was immediately drawn to Group B, where there were so many accidents, and well, now we only lost one man. That's unfair. Most of the time, they only remind us of the bad, forgetting the outstanding engineering achievements, the pilots and the ecstasy of the races.</p> <br>
        <p>Nevertheless, I am satisfied that I was able to relive the experiences of a defining era of rallying - thanks to the video tapes and the races that evoke the past, such as the Rallye Eifel. Not, of course, the more than forty Group-B cars that homologated the rally races of the 80s. But to be fair, Group B should stay where it belongs, in the past. Thank you for the many lessons! Here is a longer documentary about the world of Group B.</p>
